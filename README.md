# Minecraft Clone in React & Three.js 🧊

A 3D Minecraft-inspired sandbox game built from the ground up in the browser using React, Three.js, and the React Three Fiber ecosystem. This project serves as a deep dive into 3D rendering, physics, and state management on the web.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ehiz-js/minecraft-clone-test.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd minecraft-clone-test
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

To start the development server, run the following command. The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a blank canvas, which is the foundation for the 3D world. Development is in its early stages, with features being actively built out.

## ✨ Features & Roadmap

This project is currently under development. The goal is to implement the following features:

-   **Infinite Terrain:** A dynamically generated ground for an expansive world.
-   **First-Person Controls:** Immersive first-person perspective with camera controls.
-   **Physics & Gravity:** Player movement and interactions governed by a physics engine.
-   **Block Management:** Place and destroy various types of cubes.
-   **State Management:** Efficiently handle world and player state using Zustand.
-   **Persistent Worlds:** Save and load your creations using LocalStorage.
